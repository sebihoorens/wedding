# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization

# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:

#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#

# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

    timeline_intro: "This is our story, two people who were born and raised in different parts of the world yet somehow found each other."
    timeline_jess: "Jess came to Belgium in 2020 for her master’s program in physiotherapy. After a few weeks of online French classes (due to COVID) and only speaking Spanish with her family, she realized she needed more practice. So she joined an app to make new friends."
    timeline_sebi: >
      At the same time, Sebi was discovering new places in Belgium and enjoyed going for walks. He
      was looking for someone to join him on these adventures, and was also interested in learning
      Spanish.
    timeline_click: "What began as language practice turned into something deeper as we talked every day, met often, and really connected. We spent our time exploring new places, meeting family and friends, and making memories together."

  travel:
    title: 'Travel & Stay'
    intro: >
      For those considering travelling to Ecuador, we know that such a journey takes planning, time,
      and financial commitment. We’re incredibly grateful to anyone thinking about making the trip
      to celebrate with us. To help you decide and prepare, we’ve put together some tips and
      recommendations for travel, accommodations, and activities.
    assist: >
      We’re looking into ways to <strong>assist with logistics</strong>, such as airport transfers,
      a shuttle to the church and venue, and a shared Airbnb for guests (possibly with a swimming
      pool!). Additionally, we may be able to %{hotel_link}, including hotels near the venue. While
      we can’t cover these costs, we’ll do our best to help coordinate. If you’d like to receive
      updates about these arrangements by email, be sure to check the corresponding box during the
      RSVP process.
    assist_link: arrange discounts for accommodations
    destination_title: The Destination
    destination_regions: >
      Ecuador, located in South America, is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world.
      Being relatively small, it offers remarkably easy access to stunning landscapes across four
      unique regions:
    destination_amazon_title: 'The Amazon Rainforest'
    destination_amazon_body: 'Explore lush jungles, exotic wildlife, and indigenous cultures.'
    destination_andes_title: 'The Andes Mountains'
    destination_andes_body: 'Hike volcanoes, visit highland villages and enjoy the breathtaking scenery.'
    destination_pacific_title: 'The Pacific Coast'
    destination_pacific_body: 'Relax on sandy beaches or surf in coastal towns.'
    destination_galapagos_title: 'The Galápagos Islands'
    destination_galapagos_body: 'Experience unparalleled wildlife and pristine beaches.'
    language: >
      The main language in Ecuador is <strong>Spanish</strong>. Everyone speaks Spanish in the cities, and even in rural areas most people can speak Spanish. Many people can also speak English, especially younger people.
    weather: >
      Ecuador’s weather in February varies by region due to its diverse geography. In Quito and the Andean Highlands, <strong>temperature is around 13-25&deg;C</strong> with mild days, chilly nights and occasional rain. Because the sun is strong at high altitude, it’s important to wear sunscreen every time you go outside, even when it’s cloudy. We also recommend bringing a light rain jacket and checking the weather forecast before departing.
    power_plugs: >
      Power outlets in the country use <strong>type A and B plugs</strong>, similar to those in the United States. If you’re coming from Belgium or another European country, be sure to pack a suitable adapter so you can charge your devices without any trouble.
    mobile_data: >
      For reliable mobile data, a <strong>local SIM</strong> or <strong>eSIM</strong> is your best option. Claro offers the best coverage, Movistar works well in cities, and Tuenti is budget-friendly. We recommend buying your SIM card in an official store, where staff can help you set it up. It can be quite tricky to do this on your own without an Ecuadorian residence. If your phone supports it, eSIMs are usually more expensive, but more convenient, as you can activate your plan immediately upon arrival. %{airalo_link} offers Ecuador-specific or regional plans, but you can find cheaper eSIM providers through %{esimdb_link} (watch out: the cheap ones often don’t include calls or SMS and may already activate as soon as you have paid).
    currency: >
      Ecuador uses the <strong>U.S. dollar</strong>, but payment methods vary. In Quito and major cities, most restaurants, supermarkets, and malls accept cards, while small shops, buses, and markets require cash (in small bills). In rural areas, cash is essential. Banco Internacional ATMs are best for Visa cards (often fee-free), and Revolut seems to work well for card payments. ATMs can be scarce outside cities, so withdraw money in a safe place and carry enough cash when travelling.
    tipping: >
      <strong>Tipping</strong> is much more common in Ecuador than in Belgium. In restaurants, a 10% service charge is often included in the bill. If not, leaving 5-10% is customary for good service. Taxi drivers don’t expect tips, but rounding up the fare is common. Hotel staff and tour guides appreciate small tips: &#36;1-2 per bag for porters and &#36;5-10 per day for guides, depending on the service. In markets and small eateries, tipping isn’t necessary.
    getting_to_ecuador_title: 'Getting To Ecuador'
    getting_to_ecuador_low_season: >
      The wedding will take place during the low season, as February is one of the most affordable months to fly to Ecuador. To get the best prices, we recommend booking your flight 6-8 months in advance. Prices of round-trip flights from Europe typically start from &#8364;800 per person, with airlines like Air Europa, Iberia, and KLM offering the most budget-friendly options. These flights usually have stopovers in Madrid or Amsterdam. When booking, we suggest choosing shorter layovers. A 17-hour journey is already long and tiring, so there’s no need to extend it further!
    getting_to_ecuador_airport: >
      Since the wedding will take place around Quito (the historic center and Puembo), we recommend flying into Mariscal Sucre International Airport, which is about 45 minutes from the city.
    getting_to_ecuador_visa: >
      Most nationalities can visit Ecuador visa-free for up to 90 days within a 12-month period, but <strong>passports</strong> must be valid for at least six months upon entry. Border officials may ask for proof of onward travel. For the latest entry requirements, check the website of Foreign Affairs of your country (for example, %{foreign_affairs_link}) before departure. Additional entry requirements apply for the Galápagos Islands, see the %{galapagos_link} section on our %{exploring_link} page.
    getting_to_ecuador_belgian_foreign_affairs: Belgian Foreign Affairs
    health_title: Health
    health_altitude: >
      We recommend arriving a few days before the wedding to allow time to adjust to the <strong>altitude</strong>. Quito sits at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">9&thinsp;350&thinsp;feet</span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(2&thinsp;850&thinsp;m)</span> above sea level, and it can take some time for your body to acclimate.
    health_vaccinations: >
      Before your trip, consider discussing your travel plans with your doctor or a travel clinic, ideally eight to ten weeks before departure. Commonly recommended <strong>vaccinations</strong> include <strong>yellow fever</strong>, <strong>hepatitis A</strong>, and <strong>tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (whooping cough)</strong>. These vaccines typically cost around &#8364;80, and part of the expense may be covered by your health insurance.
    health_insurance: >
      <strong>Travel insurance</strong> isn’t mandatory for Ecuador, but we highly recommend it. Private clinics generally offer better care than public hospitals, and insurance can help cover medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage, and theft. It’s especially valuable if you plan to explore remote areas like the Amazon or Galápagos, or take part in outdoor activities. In Belgium, you can often get travel insurance through your credit card company (this might only be possible if you booked your flights with their credit card), your bank, or with %{touring_link}.
    health_food_safety: >
      Be mindful of <strong>food and water safety</strong> during your trip. Always drink bottled or filtered water, including when brushing your teeth or washing fruits and vegetables, as tap water isn’t always safe to drink. Hygiene standards can vary, especially in smaller, budget-friendly restaurants, so it’s best to avoid raw vegetables, salads, and undercooked meats, particularly pork and seafood.
    health_dining_out: >
      When dining out, opt for busy, well-reviewed restaurants and be cautious with street food, choosing vendors with high turnover. Sticking to thoroughly cooked meals and practicing good hygiene will help ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip!
    safety_title: Safety
    safety_intro: >
      Ecuador is a beautiful and welcoming country, but as with any travel destination, it’s important to stay aware of your surroundings and use your common sense. Official travel advisories from countries like Belgium, Canada, the UK, and the US provide useful information, but keep in mind that they tend to sound a bit dramatic (similar warnings exist for Brussels). With the right precautions, you’ll be able to fully enjoy your trip and explore with confidence. Here are some key tips to keep in mind:
    safety_transport_title: 'Use safe transport'
    safety_transport_body: >
      Stick to hotel-arranged rides or registered taxis.
    safety_valuables_title: 'Keep valuables secure'
    safety_valuables_body: >
      Avoid displaying jewelry, expensive gadgets, or large amounts of cash. Use an anti-theft bag in busy areas.
    safety_crowded_places_title: 'Stay aware in crowded places'
    safety_crowded_places_body: >
      Markets, bus stations, and tourist hotspots can attract pickpockets.
    safety_scams_title: 'Beware of scams'
    safety_scams_body: >
      Be cautious of distraction tactics, like strangers asking for help with a map or newspaper. Stay alert.
    safety_night_areas_title: 'Avoid certain areas at night'
    safety_night_areas_body: >
      Some neighbourhoods in Guayaquil, Esmeraldas, Manabí, and Quito can be unsafe after dark. Ask locals or your hotel for advice, stick to well-lit areas, and avoid walking alone.
    safety_cash_title: 'Withdraw cash safely'
    safety_cash_body: >
      Use ATMs inside banks or shopping malls, not on the street.
    safety_documents_title: 'Keep copies of important documents'
    safety_documents_body: >
      Store copies of your passport, visa, and travel insurance separately from the originals.
    safety_register_title: 'Register your travel'
    safety_register_body: >
      In case of an emergency, government services can get in touch with you or your contact person and help you get back home. In Belgium, you can register with %{travellersonline_link}.
    safety_closing: >
      With basic precautions, Ecuador is an amazing place to visit! Stay safe, enjoy the wedding, and make the most of your time exploring.
    wedding_day_title: 'The Day Of The Wedding'
    wedding_day_to_plan: >
      Looking for the schedule, gift information, or other wedding details? Head over to %{plan_link} on our homepage!
    wedding_day_children: >
      <strong>Children</strong> are welcome, but please keep in mind that there will be alcohol and
      possibly open fires. Please, make sure to include your children as plus ones when you RSVP.
      If many children attend, we may arrange for a nanny to help with supervision so you can fully
      enjoy the party. Unfortunately, <strong>pets</strong> are not allowed at the venue.
    dress_code_title: Dress Code
    dress_code_intro: >
      We’d love to see our friends and family dressed up for our big day! While we encourage elegant attire, there’s no need for anything too formal. Your comfort is what matters most.
    dress_code_palette: >
      Our dress code is cocktail/semi-formal, and the colour palette of our wedding largely consists of burgundy <span style="color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 0 #660505;">&#129505;</span> and navy blue <span style="color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 0 #343173;">&#129505;</span>. We kindly ask that you avoid white, ivory, and cream, as these are traditionally reserved for the bride. Due to uneven terrain, stilettos are not recommended. Block heels, wedges, or flats will keep you comfortable throughout the day.
    dress_code_weather: >
      Quito’s weather can be unpredictable, with temperatures around 15-25&deg;C in the afternoon, dropping to around 10&deg;C at night, sometimes with light rain. Since parts of the celebration will be outdoors, we suggest bringing a light jacket or shawl just in case.
    dress_code_closing: >
      Most importantly, wear something you love, feel great in, and can dance all night in! &#10024;
    where_to_stay_title: 'Where To Stay'
    where_to_stay_intro: >
      For convenience and safety, we recommend staying in Quito’s north-central area or in the nearby valleys of Tumbaco, Cumbayá, or Puembo, as the wedding will take place in the historic center and Puembo. These areas offer a variety of hotels and Airbnbs, making it easier to return safely after celebrating with us!
    where_to_stay_hotel_san_jose: >
      We’ve secured a special rate at hotel %{hotel_link}, a charming 17<sup>th</sup> century hacienda near the wedding venue (15mins by car). This beautiful hotel features a swimming pool, fitness center, breakfast, and airport transfers for a comfortable stay. Our discounted rate is &#36;85 for a double room. You can email %{email_link}, mentioning <em>boda Hoorens-León</em>, to book at this rate.
    where_to_stay_hotel_go_quito: >
      We’ve also arranged a special offer with <em>GO Quito Hotel</em>, a modern hotel in the city. The promotion includes breakfast, access to the
      sauna, pool, and gym. You can
      <a href="https://booking.profitroom.com/en/goquitohotel/home?currency=USD&codes=bodaHoorensLeon&no-cache=1" target="_blank">book directly through this link</a>
      or use the code <strong style="font-weight: 700;">bodaHoorensLeon</strong> on their website to get the special rate.
    church_title: 'The Church'
    church_intro: >
      Our ecclesiastical ceremony will take place at the 17<sup>th</sup> century <strong>Iglesia de Santo Domingo</strong>, located in Quito’s historic center, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Originally founded by the Dominican Order in the late 16<sup>th</sup> century, the current church showcases a blend of Baroque, Gothic, and Moorish architectural elements. Its wooden Mudéjar-style ceiling, inspired by Islamic art, is among its most admired features. The ceremony will be held in the Chapel of the Rosary (Capilla del Rosario), considered one of the most beautiful chapels in Latin America.
    church_timing: >
      Though Ecuadorians are known for their relaxed approach to time, church ceremonies begin promptly. We recommend arriving at least 20 minutes early (by 1:40pm) to ensure a smooth start.
    church_transport: >
      <strong>We recommend taking a taxi</strong> to reach the church. Make sure to use a registered taxi with an orange license plate, and confirm that the meter is running correctly. If possible, book your taxi through a trusted hotel or restaurant.
    church_parking: >
      Guests arriving by car may park inside the church parking lot (we have arranged access for you). Please note that driving and parking in Quito’s historic center can be challenging due to narrow streets and traffic, so allow extra time. The entrance to the parking is located on Juan José Flores Street, on the left of the church (see image below).
    church_metro: >
      The church also accessible via Quito’s metro. The nearest station, San Francisco, is about a 5-10 minute walk away (follow Simón Bolívar street). The path is slightly downhill and may be tricky in formal shoes or high heels.
    church_bus: >
      A Trolebús is conveniently located right in front of Plaza Santo Domingo, offering an easy way to reach the church by bus.
    venue_title: 'The Venue'
    venue_intro: >
      The reception with dinner and drinks will take place at Quinta El Alcázar in Puembo.
    venue_shuttle: >
      We’re planning to provide a shuttle to get to Quinta El Alcázar from the church.
    venue_parking: >
        For the easiest route by car, we recommend using a navigation app like Waze. The turn onto Calle Sta. Rosa (El Alcázar’s street) comes shortly after the roundabout when arriving from Ruta Viva and can be easy to miss (see image below). Upon arrival, you’ll pass through security, so please bring your ID or passport. Only guests on the list will be admitted.
  exploring:
    title: 'Exploring Ecuador'
    quito_title: 'Quito'
    quito_body_intro: >
      Ecuador's capital <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(2&thinsp;850&thinsp;m)</span> is not just
      where our wedding will take place, but it’s also where Jess was born and raised. Quito has the
      best-preserved historic center in South America, with colonial churches and a rich blend of
      history and culture.
    quito_body_center: >
      For a deeper dive into Quito’s past, we recommend the <em>Museo de la Ciudad</em> or <em>Casa
      del Alabado</em>, both located in the center. Climb up <em>El Panecillo</em>, the iconic hill
      where the <em>Virgin of the Apocalypse</em> stands as a protector of the city, unique for her
      wings, chained serpent, and crescent moon. For a taste of local life and some great deals, head
      to the artisan market in <em>La Mariscal</em>, where you’ll find a variety of handmade crafts
      and souvenirs.
    quito_body_hikes: >
      If you’re feeling adventurous, hop on the <em>Teleférico</em> that takes you up to <span
      style="white-space: nowrap;">3&thinsp;900&thinsp;m</span> for breathtaking views and mountain
      hikes. For serious hikers, the nearby <em>Pichincha volcano</em> <span style="white-space:
      nowrap;">(4&thinsp;900&thinsp;m)</span> offers great trails, but we strongly recommend going
      with a guide for safety reasons.
    quito_body_mitad_del_mundo: >
      A little north of the city, you’ll find the <em>Mitad del Mundo</em>, the monument marking the
      Equator, with an artisan market nearby (this one is more touristic than La Mariscal).
    quito_body_stay: >
      We suggest staying at least a week in Quito: two days to explore the city (keep an eye on your
      belongings in busy areas), and the rest discovering nearby gems like <em>Papallacta</em> (hot
      springs), <em>Otavalo</em>, <em>Mindo</em>, <em>Cotopaxi</em>, and the beautiful
      <em>Quilotoa</em> lagoon. Bring warm layers when going up in the mountains.
    otavalo_title: 'Otavalo'
    otavalo_body_market: >
      Known for hosting one of South America’s most iconic indigenous markets, Otavalo is a must-visit for culture lovers. At <em>La plaza de los ponchos</em>, you’ll find a wide variety of handicrafts, textiles, and traditional artwork that reflect Ecuador’s indigenous heritage. As you wander through the market, you’ll see skilled artisans selling everything from handwoven alpaca wool clothing to carved jewelry and colourful Andean souvenirs.
    otavalo_body_lagoon: >
      A short drive away from the market, nature lovers can visit the <em>Cuicocha Lagoon</em>, a stunning crater lake with deep blue waters formed by a long-ago volcanic eruption. You can hike around or take a relaxing boat tour to enjoy the views.
    otavalo_body_waterfall: >
      Another highlight is the <em>Peguche Waterfall</em>, a sacred site for the Otavalo people, surrounded by a peaceful forest.
    cotopaxi_title: 'Cotopaxi National Park'
    cotopaxi_body_intro: >
      With wide open landscapes and the dramatic Cotopaxi Volcano towering above, this national park is a dream for hikers, bikers, and nature lovers. You can visit the mountain refuge <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(4&thinsp;800&thinsp;m)</span>, or, if you’re up for a serious challenge, attempt to reach the top <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(5&thinsp;900&thinsp;m)</span> with a guide.
    cotopaxi_body_chimborazo: >
      For an even more extreme adventure, head to <em>Chimborazo Volcano</em> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(6&thinsp;300&thinsp;m)</span>, Ecuador’s tallest peak and the closest point to the sun on Earth. A lesser-known alternative is <em>Morurco</em>, a hidden gem behind the Cotopaxi, offering diverse hiking routes and breathtaking views, without the crowds.

      Tucked into the cloud forest about two hours from Quito, Mindo is a favourite getaway for nature lovers and adventure seekers. It’s known for its rich biodiversity, with excellent birdwatching (keep an eye out for hummingbirds, toucans, and the bright red Andean cock-of-the-rock).
    mindo_body_activities: >
      You can visit butterfly farms, hike to waterfalls, or ride a tarabita (cable car). If you’re 
      up for some action, try tubing on the Mindo River, zip-lining, or even canyoning. For something 
      more relaxing, visit a chocolate tour (we recommend <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/v4DtRPbUNdZPTJE87" 
      target="_blank">Yumbos Chocolate</a>, where we had the best brownies of our lives) and see how 
      cacao is transformed into delicious chocolate.
    quilotoa_title: 'Quilotoa'
    quilotoa_body: >
      A stunning turquoise crater lake high in the Andes, formed by a long-ago volcanic eruption. You can hike along the rim for sweeping views, or walk down to the lake for a closer look. Try to go in the morning, as the crater often fills with mist in the afternoon. Nearby villages offer a glimpse into traditional Andean life.
    cuenca_title: 'Cuenca'
    cuenca_body_intro: >
      A charming city full of history, colonial architecture, and vibrant local culture. Cuenca was once an important Inca city. Today, it’s one of South America’s cities with the best quality of life, making it popular with digital nomads.
    cuenca_body_activities: >
      Don’t miss the iconic blue domes of the <em>Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepción</em> (climb up before 4:00pm for a great view). Head to <em>Mercado 10 de Agosto</em> to try dishes like mote pillo (a typical Cuencano dish) or hornado. Take a double-decker bus ride to the <em>Mirador de Turi</em>, a hilltop viewpoint perfect for photos, or venture out to <em>Cajas National Park</em> for peaceful high-altitude hikes among lakes and dramatic landscapes.
    cuenca_body_food: >
      Fun fact: the <em>Panama Hat</em> actually comes from Cuenca, not Panama! You can even visit a hat museum to learn how they’re made. If you have extra time, explore <em>Saraguro</em> for Andean Kichwa culture, or visit <em>Gualaceo</em> and <em>Chordeleg</em>, known for their handmade jewelry and textiles (perfect for a unique souvenir).
    cuenca_body_facts: >
      Ecuador’s most important Inca ruins, <em>Ingapirca</em>, offers a glimpse into the country’s pre-Columbian history. Set in the highlands north of Cuenca, the site features stone walls, ritual spaces, and the famous <em>Temple of the Sun</em>. It’s a peaceful spot to explore and imagine how the Incas once lived.
    banos_title: 'Baños'
    banos_body_intro: >
      Located between the Andes and the edge of the Amazon, Baños de Agua Santa is known as Ecuador’s adventure capital. Thrill-seekers can go rafting on the Pastaza River, canyoning through waterfalls, ziplining over deep canyons, or hiking scenic mountain trails.
    banos_body_cascadas: >
      Don’t miss the <em>Ruta de las Cascadas</em>, a road dotted with waterfalls, including the famous <em>Pailón del Diablo</em>, where walkways take you right up close to the roaring water. Visit the <em>Casa del Árbol</em>, home to the swing at the end of the world, where you can swing out over a cliff with amazing views of Tungurahua Volcano.
    banos_body_hot_springs: >
      For a slower pace, relax in the town’s natural hot springs, which are said to have healing properties. Baños also has a fun and lively nightlife, with bars and clubs where travellers gather after a day outdoors.
    amazon_title: 'The Amazon Rainforest'
    amazon_body_intro: >
      Ecuador’s slice of the Amazon is one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. With a good guide and a bit of luck, you might spot monkeys, jaguars, sloths, tamanduas, toucans, anacondas (in the second picture, you can see one sleeping next to Sebi), caimans, iguanas, poison dart frogs, and the pink river dolphin. The legendary city of gold, El Dorado, was once believed to lie somewhere in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
    amazon_body_places: >
      There are several ways to explore this incredible ecosystem, depending on how deep into the jungle you want to go:
    amazon_cuyabeno_title: 'Cuyabeno & Yasuní'
    amazon_cuyabeno_body: > 
      The most remote and pristine parts of Ecuador’s Amazon. These protected reserves are perfect for multi-day excursions and wildlife spotting. You’ll travel by canoe, sleep in eco-lodges, and be fully immersed in nature.
    amazon_tena_title: 'Tena'
    amazon_tena_body: >
      Known as the gateway to the Amazon, it’s a great base for adventure sports like rafting, while still offering access to jungle experiences and cultural visits with indigenous communities.
    amazon_puyo_title: 'Puyo'
    amazon_puyo_body: >
      Easily reachable by road, Puyo offers shorter day trips into the rainforest, plus visits to animal rescue centers and botanical gardens.
    amazon_misahualli_title: 'Misahuallí'
    amazon_misahualli_body: >
      A small riverside town where monkeys roam freely in the central plaza. From here, you can arrange jungle tours and boat rides on the Napo river.
    coast_title: 'The Pacific Coast'
    coast_body_intro: >
      Ecuador’s Pacific Coast offers warm beaches, fresh seafood, and relaxed coastal vibes. While the beaches here may not be as remote or wildlife-rich as in the Galápagos, they're perfect for surfing, swimming, and enjoying a more budget-friendly trip.
    coast_body_machalilla: >
      Nature lovers should head to <em>Machalilla National Park</em>, a coastal reserve with dry forest 
      trails, marine life, and some of Ecuador’s most scenic beaches. From <em>Puerto López</em>, you 
      can visit the famous <em>Los Frailes</em> beach (which is popular for whale watching, but only 
      between June and September).
    coast_body_ayampe: >
      For a slower pace, <em>Ayampe</em> is a peaceful surf town known for yoga retreats, beach walks, and amazing food. It’s quiet and relaxing, but close enough to <em>Montañita</em> and <em>Olón</em> if you’re looking for bars and nightlife.
    coast_body_cuisine: >
      Ecuador’s <em>coastal cuisine</em> is a highlight on its own. Try ceviche, encocado (a coconut seafood stew), grilled fish, and plantain-based dishes like patacones and bolones.
    coast_body_safety: >
      Avoid travelling at night and keep an eye on your belongings, especially on the beach or in busier towns. Most destinations not mentioned on this page are best avoided, and we don’t recommend visiting Guayaquil unless absolutely necessary (e.g. for the airport).
    galapagos_title: 'The Galápagos Archipelago'
    galapagos_body_intro: >
      A true paradise on Earth, the Galápagos Islands are famous for their incredible wildlife and otherworldly landscapes. Because there are so few natural predators, animals here aren’t afraid of humans, making it easy to observe (and photograph) sea lions, blue-footed boobies, giant tortoises, penguins, iguanas, albatrosses, and more up close.
    galapagos_body_conservation: >
      The islands inspired Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, and today they remain one of the world’s most unique ecosystems. Strict conservation rules help keep it that way: you’re not allowed to touch the animals, feed them, or stray from marked paths. You also can’t bring in fresh produce, seeds, or animal products, so pack accordingly.
    galapagos_body_visit: >
      To visit, you’ll need to fly from mainland Ecuador (Quito or Guayaquil) and pass through an extra checkpoint for your luggage. You’ll also pay two separate fees: a &#36;20 Transit Control Card at the airport, and a &#36;100 national park entrance fee upon arrival.
    galapagos_body_guide: >
      While it’s possible to plan your own visit, we strongly recommend going with a guide or a tour. Most places can only be accessed with authorized guides, and they’ll help you make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime experience.
