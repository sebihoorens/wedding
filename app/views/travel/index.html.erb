        <p>For our traveling guests, we know that a trip to Ecuador requires careful planning, time, and financial commitment—and we are incredibly grateful for the effort you’re making to celebrate with us. To help make your journey smoother, we’ve put together some tips and recommendations for travel, accommodations, and activities.</p>

        <h2>The Destination</h2>
        <p>Ecuador, located in South America, is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. Being relatively small, it offers remarkably easy access to stunning landscapes across four unique regions:</p>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-4">The Amazon Rainforest</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Explore lush jungles, exotic wildlife, and indigenous cultures.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">The Andes Mountains</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Hike volcanoes, visit highland villages and enjoy the breathtaking scenery.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">The Pacific Coast</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Relax on sandy beaches or surf in coastal towns.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">The Galápagos Islands</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Experience unparalleled wildlife and pristine beaches.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Getting To Ecuador</h2>
        <p>The wedding will take place during the low season, as February is one of the most affordable times of the year to fly to Ecuador. To secure good prices, booking your flight 6-8 months in advance is recommended.</p>
        <p>Airlines like Air Europa, Iberia, and KLM offer the more affordable flights from Europe with stopovers in Madrid or Amsterdam. The cheapest round-trip flights typically range around &#8364;700-&#8364;800 per person. We recommend choosing flights with shorter layovers, as a 17-hour trip is already long and tiring&mdash;no need to make it even longer!</p>

        <p>As the wedding will take place around Quito (Guápulo and Puembo), we recommend staying in the northern and central regions of the city for convenience and safety.</p>

        <h2>Health &amp; Vaccinations</h2>
        <p>To ensure a safe and healthy trip, we recommend discussing your travel plans with your doctor or at a travel clinic, ideally eight to ten weeks before departure. Commonly recommended vaccinations include <strong>yellow fever</strong>, <strong>hepatitis A</strong>, and <strong>tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (whooping cough)</strong>. The cost for these vaccines is around &#8364;80, and part of it may be covered by your health insurance.</p>
