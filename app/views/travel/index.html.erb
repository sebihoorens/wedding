        <p>For our traveling guests, we know that a trip to Ecuador requires careful planning, time, and financial commitment&mdash;and we are incredibly grateful for the effort you’re making to celebrate with us. To help make your journey smoother, we’ve put together some tips and recommendations for travel, accommodations, and activities.</p>

        <p>We’re looking into ways to assist with logistics, such as airport transfers, a shuttle to the church and venue, and a shared Airbnb for guests (possibly with a swimming pool!). Additionally, we may be able to arrange discounts for accommodations, including hotels near the venue. While we can’t cover these costs, we’ll do our best to help coordinate. If you’d like to receive updates about these arrangements by email, be sure to check the corresponding box during the RSVP process.</p>

        <h2>The Destination</h2>
        <p>Ecuador, located in South America, is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. Being relatively small, it offers remarkably easy access to stunning landscapes across four unique regions:</p>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-4">The Amazon Rainforest</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Explore lush jungles, exotic wildlife, and indigenous cultures.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">The Andes Mountains</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Hike volcanoes, visit highland villages and enjoy the breathtaking scenery.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">The Pacific Coast</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Relax on sandy beaches or surf in coastal towns.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">The Galápagos Islands</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Experience unparalleled wildlife and pristine beaches.</dd>

        <h2>Getting To Ecuador</h2>
        <p>The wedding will take place during the low season, as February is one of the most affordable months to fly to Ecuador. To get the best prices, we recommend booking your flight 6–8 months in advance. Round-trip flights from Europe typically cost &#8364;700–&#8364;800 per person, with airlines like Air Europa, Iberia, and KLM offering the most budget-friendly options. These flights usually have stopovers in Madrid or Amsterdam. When booking, we suggest choosing shorter layovers&mdash;a 17-hour journey is already long and tiring, so there's no need to extend it further!</p>
        <p>Since the wedding will take place around Quito (Guápulo and Puembo), we recommend flying into Mariscal Sucre International Airport, which is about 45 minutes from the city.</p>

        <h2>Health &amp; Vaccinations</h2>
        <p>To ensure a safe and healthy trip, we recommend discussing your travel plans with your doctor or at a travel clinic, ideally eight to ten weeks before departure. Commonly recommended vaccinations include <strong>yellow fever</strong>, <strong>hepatitis A</strong>, and <strong>tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (whooping cough)</strong>. The cost for these vaccines is around &#8364;80, and part of it may be covered by your health insurance.</p>
