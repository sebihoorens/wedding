        <p>For those considering traveling to Ecuador, we know that such a journey takes planning, time, and financial commitment. We're incredibly grateful to anyone thinking about making the trip to celebrate with us. To help you decide and prepare, we’ve put together some tips and recommendations for travel, accommodations, and activities.</p>

        <p>We’re looking into ways to <strong>assist with logistics</strong>, such as airport transfers, a shuttle to the church and venue, and a shared Airbnb for guests (possibly with a swimming pool!). Additionally, we may be able to <%= link_to('arrange discounts for accommodations', '#hotel-san-jose') %>, including hotels near the venue. While we can’t cover these costs, we’ll do our best to help coordinate. If you’d like to receive updates about these arrangements by email, be sure to check the corresponding box during the RSVP process.</p>

        <h2>The Destination</h2>
        <p>Ecuador, located in South America, is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. Being relatively small, it offers remarkably easy access to stunning landscapes across four unique regions:</p>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-4">The Amazon Rainforest</dt>
          <dd class="col-8">Explore lush jungles, exotic wildlife, and indigenous cultures.</dd>

          <dt class="col-4">The Andes Mountains</dt>
          <dd class="col-8">Hike volcanoes, visit highland villages and enjoy the breathtaking scenery.</dd>

          <dt class="col-4">The Pacific Coast</dt>
          <dd class="col-8">Relax on sandy beaches or surf in coastal towns.</dd>

          <dt class="col-4">The Galápagos Islands</dt>
          <dd class="col-8">Experience unparalleled wildlife and pristine beaches.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The main language in Ecuador is <strong>Spanish</strong>. Everyone speaks Spanish in the cities, and even in rural areas most people can speak Spanish. Many people can also speak English, especially younger people.</p>

        <p>Ecuador's weather in February varies by region due to its diverse geography. In Quito and the Andean Highlands, <strong>temperature is around 13-25&deg;C</strong> with mild days, chilly nights and occasional rain. We recommend bringing a light rain jacket and checking the weather forecast before departing.</p>

        <p>For reliable mobile data, a <strong>local SIM</strong> or <strong>eSIM</strong> is your best option. Claro offers the best coverage, Movistar works well in cities, and Tuenti is budget-friendly. SIM cards are available at the airport, malls, and official stores (passport required). If your phone supports it, eSIM is usually more expensive, but more convenient, as you can activate your plan immediately upon arrival. <a href="https://www.airalo.com/ecuador-esim" target="_blank">Airalo</a> offers Ecuador-specific or regional plans, but you can find cheaper eSIM providers through <a href="https://esimdb.com/ecuador" target="_blank">esimdb</a> (watch out: the cheap ones often don't include calls or SMS and may already activate as soon as you paid).

        <p>Ecuador uses the <strong>U.S. dollar</strong>, but payment methods vary. In Quito and major cities, most restaurants, supermarkets, and malls accept cards, while small shops, buses, and markets require cash (in small bills). In rural areas, cash is essential. Banco Internacional ATMs are best for Visa cards (often fee-free), and Revolut seems to work well for card payments. ATMs can be scarce outside cities, so withdraw money in a safe place and carry enough cash when traveling.</p>

        <p><strong>Tipping</strong> is much more common in Ecuador than in Belgium. In restaurants, a 10% service charge is often included in the bill. If not, leaving 5-10% is customary for good service. Taxi drivers don’t expect tips, but rounding up the fare is common. Hotel staff and tour guides appreciate small tips: &#36;1-2 per bag for porters and &#36;5-10 per day for guides, depending on the service. In markets and small eateries, tipping isn’t necessary.</p>

        <h2>Getting To Ecuador</h2>
        <p>The wedding will take place during the low season, as February is one of the most affordable months to fly to Ecuador. To get the best prices, we recommend booking your flight 6-8 months in advance. Prices of round-trip flights from Europe typically start from &#8364;800 per person, with airlines like Air Europa, Iberia, and KLM offering the most budget-friendly options. These flights usually have stopovers in Madrid or Amsterdam. When booking, we suggest choosing shorter layovers. A 17-hour journey is already long and tiring, so there's no need to extend it further!</p>
        <p>Since the wedding will take place around Quito (Guápulo and Puembo), we recommend flying into Mariscal Sucre International Airport, which is about 45 minutes from the city.</p>
        <p>Most nationalities can visit Ecuador visa-free for up to 90 days within a 12-month period, but <strong>passports</strong> must be valid for at least six months upon entry. Border officials may ask for proof of onward travel. For the latest entry requirements, check the website of Foreign Affairs of your coutry (for example, <a href="https://diplomatie.belgium.be/nl/landen/ecuador/reizen-naar-ecuador-reisadvies/praktische-info-voor-ecuador" target="_blank">Belgian Foreign Affairs</a>) before departure. Additional entry requirements apply for the Galápagos Islands.</p>

        <h2 id="travel-health"><%= t :travel_health_title %></h2>
        <p>We recommend arriving a few of days before the wedding to allow time to adjust to the <strong>altitude</strong>. Quito sits at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">9&thinsp;350&thinsp;feet</span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(2&thinsp;850&thinsp;m)</span> above sea level, and it can take some time for your body to acclimate.</p>
        <p>Before your trip, consider discussing your travel plans with your doctor or a travel clinic, ideally eight to ten weeks before departure. Commonly recommended <strong>vaccinations</strong> include <strong>yellow fever</strong>, <strong>hepatitis A</strong>, and <strong>tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (whooping cough)</strong>. These vaccines typically cost around &#8364;80, and part of the expense may be covered by your health insurance.</p>
        <p><strong>Travel insurance</strong> isn't mandatory for Ecuador, but we highly recommend it. Private clinics generally offer better care than public hospitals, and insurance can help cover medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage, and theft. It’s especially valuable if you plan to explore remote areas like the Amazon or Galápagos or take part in outdoor activities. In Belgium, you can often get a travel insurance through your credit card company (this might only be possible if you booked your flights with their credit card), your bank, or with <a href="https://www.touring.be/" target="_blank">Touring</a>.</p>
        <p>Be mindful of <strong>food and water safety</strong> during your trip. Always drink bottled or filtered water, including when brushing your teeth or washing fruits and vegetables, as tap water isn’t always safe to drink. Hygiene standards can vary, especially in smaller, budget-friendly restaurants, so it's best to avoid raw vegetables, salads, and undercooked meats, particularly pork and seafood.</p>
        <p>When dining out, opt for busy, well-reviewed restaurants and be cautious with street food, choosing vendors with high turnover. Sticking to thoroughly cooked meals and practicing good hygiene will help ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip!</p>

        <h2 id="travel-safety"><%= t :travel_safety_title %></h2>
        <p>Ecuador is a beautiful and welcoming country, but as with any travel destination, it’s important to stay aware of your surroundings and use your common sense. Official travel advisories from countries like Belgium, Canada, the UK, and the US provide useful information, but keep in mind that they tend to sound a bit dramatic (similar warnings exist for Brussels). With the right precautions, you’ll be able to fully enjoy your trip and explore with confidence. Here are some key tips to keep in mind:</p>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-4">&#128661; Use safe transport</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Stick to hotel-arranged rides, Uber, or registered taxis.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">&#127890; Keep valuables secure</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Avoid displaying jewelry, expensive gadgets, or large amounts of cash. Use an anti-theft bag in busy areas.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">&#127757; Stay aware in crowded places</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Markets, bus stations, and tourist hotspots can attract pickpockets.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">&#10071; Beware of scams</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Be cautious of distraction tactics, like strangers asking for help with a map or newspaper. Stay alert.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">&#127769; Avoid certain areas at night</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Some neighborhoods in Guayaquil, Esmeraldas, Manabí, and Quito can be unsafe after dark. Ask locals or your hotel for advice, stick to well-lit areas, and avoid walking alone.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">&#128176; Withdraw cash safely</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Use ATMs inside banks or shopping malls, not on the street.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">&#128706; Keep copies of important documents</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">Store copies of your passport, visa, and travel insurance separately from the originals.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-4">&#128269; Register your travel</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-8">In case of emergency, government services can get in touch with you or your contact person and help you get back home. In Belgium, you can register with <a href="https://travellersonline.diplomatie.be/" target="_blank">travellersonline</a>.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>With basic precautions, Ecuador is an amazing place to visit! Stay safe, enjoy the wedding, and make the most of your time exploring.</p>

        <h2 id="wedding-day-dress-code"><%= t(:wedding_day_dress_code_title) %></h2>
        <p>We’d love to see our friends and family dressed up for our big day! While we encourage elegant attire, there's no need for anything too formal. Your comfort is what matters most.</p>
        <p>Our dress code is cocktail/semi-formal, and the colour palette of our wedding largely consists of burgundy <span style="color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 0 #660505;">&#129505;</span>, navy blue <span style="color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 0 #343173;">&#129505;</span>, and emerald green <span style="color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 0 #00674F;">&#129505;</span>. We kindly ask that you avoid white, ivory, and cream, as these are traditionally reserved for the bride. Due to uneven terrain, stilettos are not recommended. Block heels, wedges, or flats will keep you comfortable throughout the day.</p>
        <p>Quito’s weather can be unpredictable, with temperatures around 15-25&deg;C in the afternoon, dropping to around 10&deg;C at night, sometimes with light rain. Since parts of the celebration will be outdoors, we suggest bringing a light jacket or shawl just in case.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, wear something you love, feel great in, and can dance all night in! &#10024;</p>

        <h2 id="wedding-day-where-to-stay"><%= t :wedding_day_where_to_stay_title %></h2>
        <p>For convenience and safety, we recommend staying in Quito's north-central area or in the nearby valleys of Tumbaco, Cumbayá, or Puembo, as the wedding will take place in Guápulo and Puembo. These areas offer a variety of hotels and Airbnbs, making it easier to return safely after celebrating with us!</p>

        <h2 id="wedding-day-church"><%= t :church_name %></h2>
        <p>Our ecclesiastical ceremony is planned to take place at <strong>La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Guápulo</strong>, one of Quito’s oldest and most beautiful churches. This 17<sup>th</sup> century Baroque landmark sits on a small plateau between Quito and the Tumbaco Valley, along the historic route taken by Pizarro’s expedition to the Amazon.</p>
        <p>While we are still awaiting final confirmation for our reservation at the Santuario De Guápulo, this remains our intended location. We will update you as soon as we have official confirmation.</p>
        <p>Though Ecuadorians are known for their relaxed approach to timing, church ceremonies start promptly. We recommend <strong>arriving</strong> at least 20 minutes early (2:40pm) to ensure a smooth start.</p>
        <p>&#128661; <strong>We recommend taking a taxi or Uber</strong> to get to the church. Make sure to use a registered taxi, with an orange license plate, and check that the meter is running correctly. If possible, book your taxi through a trusted hotel, restaurant or taxi app (we recommend Uber). Ask your driver to drop you off at the entrance of the church to avoid climbing up steep streets in formal attire.</p>
        <p>&#128663; We do not reccomend going to the church by car, as it can be tricky for gringo's to navigate the streets of Quito. The parking of the church is small and street parking is scarce. If you still decide to come by car, we recommend these routes:</p>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-4">From La Floresta / González Suárez</dt>
          <dd class="col-8">Take Camino de Orellana, a steep and winding road (5-10 min).</dd>

          <dt class="col-4">From La Carolina / La Mariscal</dt>
          <dd class="col-8">Take Av. 6 de Diciembre, then González Suárez, then Camino de Orellana (15-20 min).</dd>

          <dt class="col-4">From the center of Quito</dt>
          <dd class="col-8">Take Av. 12 de Octubre, then González Suárez, then Camino de Orellana (15-20 min).</dd>

          <dt class="col-4">From Cumbayá / Tumbaco</dt>
          <dd class="col-8">Take Av. Simón Bolívar, then Interoceánica, then follow the signs to Guápulo (25-30 min).</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>&#128694; If you're staying near González Suárez, you could get to the church by walking down the Camino de Orellana, but take into account that this is a steep descent that requires proper shoes.</p>

        <h2 id="wedding-day-venue"><%= t :venue_name %></h2>
        <p>The reception with dinner and drinks will take place at Quinta El Alcázar in Puembo.</p>
        <p>&#128656; We're planning to provide a shuttle to get to Quinta El Alcázar from the church.</p>
        <p>&#128663; For those who prefer going by car (15-20 min): take  Camino de Orellana, then González Suárez, then Av. Simón Bolívar towards Tumbaco. Continue until you reach the signs for Quinta El Alcázar.</p>
