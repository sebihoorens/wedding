        <h3>Quito</h3>
        <p>Ecuador's capital <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(2&thinsp;850&thinsp;m)</span> is not just where our wedding will take place, but it’s also where Jess was born and raised. Quito has the best-preserved historic center in South America, with colonial churches and a rich blend of history and culture.</p>
        <p>For a deeper dive into Quito’s past, we recommend the <em>Museo de la Ciudad</em> or <em>Casa del Alabado</em>, both located in the center. Climb up <em>El Panecillo</em>, the iconic hill where the <em>Virgin of the Apocalypse</em> stands as a protector of the city, unique for her wings, chained serpent, and crescent moon.</p>
        <p>If you're feeling adventurous, hop on the <em>Teleférico</em> that takes you up to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">3&thinsp;900&thinsp;m</span> for breathtaking views and mountain hikes. For serious hikers, the nearby <em>Pichincha volcano</em> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(4&thinsp;900&thinsp;m)</span> offers great trails, but we strongly recommend going with a guide for safety reasons.</p>
        <p>A little north of the city, you’ll find <em>Mitad del Mundo</em>, the monument marking the Equator, with an artisan market nearby.</p>
        <p>We suggest staying at least a week in Quito: two days to explore the city, and the rest discovering nearby gems like <em>Papallacta</em> (hot springs), <em>Otavalo</em>, <em>Mindo</em>, <em>Cotopaxi</em>, and the beautiful <em>Quilotoa</em> lagoon. Keep an eye on your belongings in busy areas.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Otavalo</h3>
        <p>Home to one of South America's most famous indigenous markets, <em>La plaza de los ponchos</em>, where you can find vibrant handicrafts, textiles, and traditional artwork reflecting Ecuador’s rich culture. Strolling through the market, you'll see skilled artisans selling everything from handwoven alpaca wool garments to intricately carved jewelry and colorful Andean souvenirs.</p>
        <p>Beyond the market, nature lovers can visit the <em>Cuicocha Lagoon</em>, a stunning crater lake with deep blue waters formed by an ancient volcanic eruption, perfect for hiking or a boat tour. Another must-see is the <em>Peguche Waterfall</em>, a sacred site for the Kichwa people, surrounded by lush forest and ideal for a peaceful nature walk.</p>

        <h3>Cotopaxi National Park</h3>
        <p>Stunning landscapes perfect for hiking, biking, and exploring its rugged terrain. Adventurers can visit the mountain refuge or, for a greater challenge, attempt to summit Cotopaxi Volcano <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(5&thinsp;900&thinsp;m)</span>, one of the world’s highest active volcanoes.</p>
        <p>For an even more extreme climb, <em>Chimborazo Volcano</em> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(6&thinsp;300&thinsp;m)</span> stands as Ecuador’s tallest peak and the closest point to the sun on Earth, with trails ranging from beginner hikes to expert-level ascents. A lesser-known alternative is <em>Morurco</em>, a hidden gem behind Cotopaxi, offering diverse hiking routes and breathtaking views with fewer crowds.</p>

For thrill-seekers, there’s tubing on the Mindo River, ziplining across the treetops, and canyoning down waterfalls. Chocolate lovers can indulge in cacao farm tours, learning about the process from bean to bar, with delicious tastings included.

        <h3>Quilotoa</h3>
        <p>A breathtaking turquoise crater lake awaits in the Ecuadorian Andes, formed within the collapsed caldera of an ancient volcano. Quilotoa is one of the most stunning destinations in the country, offering dramatic panoramic views, rugged hiking trails, and a glimpse into local indigenous culture. Whether you trek along the crater rim, descend to the water’s edge, or explore the surrounding highland villages, this natural wonder is a must-visit for adventurers and nature lovers alike.

        <h3>Cuenca</h3>
        <p>A beautiful city to explore, with its colonial streets, stunning cathedral domes (go up before 4:00pm for the best views!), and delicious local food at <em>Mercado 10 de Agosto</em> (try the mote pillo or hornado). If you’re up for an adventure, take a double-decker bus tour to <em>Turi</em> for an incredible city view or head out to <em>Cajas National Park</em> for some amazing hikes.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: the <em>Panama Hat</em> actually comes from Cuenca, not Panama! There’s even a museum where you can learn all about it. If you have time, visit <em>Saraguro</em> to experience Andean Kichwa culture or check out <em>Gualaceo</em> and <em>Chordeleg</em>, where artisans create beautiful handmade jewelry and textiles (perfect for a unique souvenir!).</p>

One of the town’s highlights is the route of waterfalls, where you can visit <em>Pailón del Diablo</em>, a powerful cascade with an immersive walkway. For a more relaxing experience, soak in the natural thermal baths, said to have healing properties. Baños also offers a vibrant nightlife scene, with bars and clubs where travelers gather after a day of adventure. Don’t miss <em>Casa del Árbol</em>, home to the famous swing at the end of the world, offering breathtaking views of Tungurahua Volcano.</p>
