        <h3>Quito</h3>
        <p>Discover Quito, home to the best-preserved historical center in South America, where colonial churches and rich history await. Just stay mindful of pickpocketing and consider a guided tour. Visit <em>El Panecillo</em>, where the Virgin of the Apocalypse stands as a protector of the city, unique for her wings, chained serpent, and crescent moon symbolism.</p>
        <p>Stop by <em>Mitad del Mundo</em>, the famous monument marking the Equator line, and browse the nearby artisan market. Take the <em>Teleférico</em> up to 3&thinsp;900&thinsp;m for breathtaking views and hiking trails. For adventure seekers, tackle <em>Rucu Pichincha</em> (4&thinsp;800&thinsp;m) or <em>Guagua Pichincha</em> (4&thinsp;900&thinsp;m), an active volcano offering panoramic vistas (guides recommended!).</p>

        <h3>Otavalo</h3>
        <p>Home to one of South America's most famous indigenous markets, <em>La plaza de los ponchos</em>, where you can find vibrant handicrafts, textiles, and traditional artwork reflecting Ecuador’s rich culture. Strolling through the market, you'll see skilled artisans selling everything from handwoven alpaca wool garments to intricately carved jewelry and colorful Andean souvenirs.</p>
        <p>Beyond the market, nature lovers can visit the <em>Cuicocha Lagoon</em>, a stunning crater lake with deep blue waters formed by an ancient volcanic eruption, perfect for hiking or a boat tour. Another must-see is the <em>Peguche Waterfall</em>, a sacred site for the Kichwa people, surrounded by lush forest and ideal for a peaceful nature walk.</p>

        <h3>Cotopaxi National Park</h3>
        <p>Stunning landscapes perfect for hiking, biking, and exploring its rugged terrain. Adventurers can visit the mountain refuge or, for a greater challenge, attempt to summit Cotopaxi Volcano (5&thinsp;900&thinsp;m), one of the world’s highest active volcanoes.</p>
        <p>For an even more extreme climb, <em>Chimborazo Volcano</em> (6&thinsp;300&thinsp;m) stands as Ecuador’s tallest peak and the closest point to the sun on Earth, with trails ranging from beginner hikes to expert-level ascents. A lesser-known alternative is <em>Morurco</em>, a hidden gem behind Cotopaxi, offering diverse hiking routes and breathtaking views with fewer crowds.</p>

Thrill-seekers can enjoy rafting on the Pastaza river, canyoning through waterfalls, ziplining across deep canyons, and hiking scenic trails. One of the town’s highlights is the route of waterfalls, where you can visit <em>Pailón del Diablo</em>, a powerful cascade with an immersive walkway. For a more relaxing experience, soak in the natural thermal baths, said to have healing properties. Baños also offers a vibrant nightlife scene, with bars and clubs where travelers gather after a day of adventure.
